Interface systems for civic tech, public-sector teams, and education professionals.

Weâ€™re building two core platforms: a flexible Svelte UI kit and a structured block engine for content workflows.

## Block Engine

A markdown-style content framework for clarity, structure, and compliance-ready workflows.

- **Typed Blocks** â€” Tasks, metrics, embeds, tags, and more

- **Standards-Aligned** â€” Built with WCAG 2.2, Section 508, and FedRAMP guidance in mind  
  _(Self-tested with automated tools; not formally certified)_

Ideal for documentation-heavy teams working in complex, regulated domains.
