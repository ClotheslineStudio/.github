### ‚ú® What We're Working On

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`clothesline-ui`](https://github.com/ClotheslineStudio/clothesline-ui) | A modular Svelte component system with full theme support and accessibility built in. Shared across all our studio tools. |
| [`gravityplanner`](https://github.com/ClotheslineStudio/gravityplanner) _(coming soon)_ | A planning and documentation platform for State Education Agencies, Technical Assistance centers, and cross-agency teams. Think GitBook + Trello, but built for real-world education work. |
| [`gravitycrm`](https://github.com/ClotheslineStudio/gravitycrm) _(coming soon)_ | A clean, solo-friendly CRM for creators, consultants, and state agencies who manage people and context, not pipelines. |

### üß≠ Our Focus

- Public sector and education  
  Tools that work for SEAs, school districts, TA centers, and compliance-heavy teams  
  Purpose-built for people dealing with complex proccesses and systems

- Accessibility-first  
  WCAG and Section 508 baked into the design  
  Keyboard-friendly, screen reader tested, color-safe themes

- Documentation and knowledge  
  Structured systems for capturing plans, decisions, and toolkits  
  Designed to survive turnover, transitions, and real deadlines
